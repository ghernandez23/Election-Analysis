Data types encountered duribg this module:

Integers- used to perform mathematical calculations. The length of an integer is constrained by the amount of
RAM memory on your computer. For example, a computer with 8 GB of RAM will have 8,000,000,000 bytes. The integer
10,000,000,000,000,000,000, or 10 quintillion, will only take up 36 bytes of memory.

floating-point decimal- numbers are used to perform mathematical calculations. Floating-point decimal
numbers specify numbers that have a decimal point, like 73.81.

String variables- text or numbers wrapped by either single or double quotes, or delimiters. A delimiter is
any nonalphabetical characters used to specify the boundary between plain text or other numbers, like the single or
double quotes, or opening and closing parentheses. All characters between the quotes are part of the string; for
example, 'Hello World' or "Hello World".

Boolean- data types can have one of two values: true or false. If we pass True in the type() function, we'll get the 
data type 'bool'.

Order of Precedence:

When you need to perform more complex mathematical expressions that include any combination of division,
multiplication, addition, and subtraction, you must follow the order of precedence (operations) for arithmetic
operators. The order of precedence in Python, which follows the same guidelines as in mathematics, is:

1)Operations enclosed in parentheses are performed first.
2)Exponentiations (i.e., raising a number to a power) are performed next.
3)Multiplication and division operations are performed from left to right: *, /, //, and %.
4)Finally, addition and subtraction operations are performed from left to right.
